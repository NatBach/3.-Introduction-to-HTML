		<h3>A bit about myself</h3>
		<p>So my name is Nhan Bach and I am from Ho Chi Minh City</p>
		<h3>Education</h3>
		<p>I am currently attending Troy University, STU Campus</p>
		<h3>Something else about me yeah?</h3>
		<p>So I was born in <strong>Vietnam</strong> and <strong>Ho Chi Minh City</strong> is my hometown.</p>
			I went to <strong>Canada</strong> for my education at the age of 16.
			After graduating from <em>High School</em> in Canada I went back in <em>Vietnam</em> for my post-secondary education until now.
			<p>That's it for me there i suppose.</p>
<h3>Here is something I have just learned from my generous teacher, Steele Colt</h3>

<h4>First here is an <em>UNordered</em> list.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Since this one</li>
	<li>is an</li>
	<li>unordered list</li>
	<li>so we use</li>
	<li>the bullet points</li>
</ul>
<h4>And this one is an <em>ordered</em> list.</h4>
<ol>
	<li>This one is</li>
	<li>an ordered list</li>
	<li>so instead of bullet points</li>
	<li>we have the numbers</li>
	<li>for each line of the code</li>
</ol>
<p>This has been so awesome, has it not?</p>
<p>I typed all these lines with what is in my memory. So cool.</p>

<h4>Alright, what i am about to show you here is super cool:))</h4>
<ul>
	<li>you can make</li>
	<li>an <strong>ordered</strong> list</li> 
	<li>inside of an <strong>un</strong>ordered list</li>
<ol>
	<li>like this</li>
	<li>and this is</li>
	<li>the third line</li>
<ul>
	<li>so fking cool</li>
	<li>is it not</li>
	<li>?</li>
</ul>
<li>what do you think?</li>
<li>it is so dope, is it not?</li>
</ol>
